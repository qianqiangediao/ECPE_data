# emotion-cause-extraction-datasets
we annotated the experiencer for emotion cause extraction datasets provided by (Xia and Ding, 2019 ACL)

There are many characters in the document, among which "the woman" is the experiencer of emotion "hopeless". So we annotate the experiencer "the woman", and mark clause ID it is in, and its starting and ending position in the clause. Such annotations are flexible for subsequent studies to implement document-level or sentence-level experiencer identification tasks.
